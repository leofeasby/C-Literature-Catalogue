Compilation command:

g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -g src\main.cpp src\DatabaseManager.cpp src\Book.cpp src\Thesis.cpp src\Journal.cpp -o src\main.exe

Then run:

./myProjectExecutable

Important: If you have a current terminal open, you will have to delete all instances of the terminal before you can run the program. This is because only one terminal window can be linked to the .dat file.

My final submission overwrote my previous commits, so I have included everything I could recover in a backup-branch.
